This project is an advanced **Full Stack web application** implementing an **Academic Management System**, designed to showcase strong software engineering practices, including:

- âœ… **Clean Architecture**
- âœ… **SOLID principles**
- âœ… **Design patterns**
- âœ… **Layered and decoupled structure (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, Interface)**
- âœ… **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**
- âœ… **Modern frontend (React/Vue) with a PHP REST API**
- âœ… **Error handling, validation, testing, and basic security**

## ðŸ§  What does this system do?

The system manages the core entities of an academic environment. It's designed as a solid base that could grow into a full Learning Management System (LMS). Main functionality includes:

### ðŸŽ“ Student Module (implemented)
- Create, read, update, and delete students
- Duplicate detection
- Lookup by national ID (DNI)
- MySQL persistence with PDO

---

### ðŸ’¼ Proposed future modules:

1. **Teacher Management**
   - Full CRUD operations
   - Assignment to courses

2. **Course Management**
   - Subject CRUD
   - Linkage to teachers and students

3. **Enrollment System**
   - Students enrolling in multiple subjects
   - Validation of business rules

4. **Evaluation System**
   - Grade input and tracking
   - GPA calculations
   - Per-student/course reports

5. **Authentication & Roles (JWT)**
   - Admin / Teacher / Student roles
   - Role-based access control

6. **Interactive Dashboard (Frontend)**
   - Intuitive UI built with React or Vue
   - Consuming PHP RESTful API
   - Data visualization (using Chart.js)

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

This project is not just a practice in PHP â€” it is a real demonstration of scalable, maintainable, and professional software architecture. Itâ€™s designed to be easily extended and adapted to new requirements. It can serve as the base for a complete academic platform or any large-scale CRUD system.
